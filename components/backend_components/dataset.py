# will need to import data transformation functions here (found in data_transformation module)

#Major Consideration: Given that there is data that we will need to know for each PCAP,
# we may want to consider introducing a PCAP class and store every added pcap as an object.

class dataset:
    print("testing")
    # for creation of some dataset, we need at least one PCAP file, cannot allow without

    # dataset contains pcap files. Appendable list of pcap files

    # function add_pcaps

    # can add by specifying a PCAP or set of PCAPS (Ability to select pcaps within given set of pcaps)

    # knows total number of packets

    # knows time span (??)

    # knows protocols (Needs to be able to seperate by protocol type and number of occurances)

    # knows original PCAP names

    # knows where PCAP originated from

    # knows PCAP editable free text meta-data
